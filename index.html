                <dt><b>Standard D3 Maps (using lon-lat geographic coordinates)</b>:</dt>
                <dd>The standard way the D3 geo methods work is with data in lon-lat geographic coordinates, being
                    projected by
                    <tt>d3.geo</tt>
                    functions. Versatile and powerful, especially if using <tt>topojson</tt> data.

                <dt><a href="RDproj_test/"><b>Maps using projected meter coordinates</b>:</a></dt>
                <dd>Map a geojson with cartesian coordinates, instead of lat-lon's (in this case the Dutch RD) --
                    Uses an override of standard D3 geo projection behaviour:
                    don't perform a full projection and resampling, but only a 1st order (affine) translation and
                    scaling to transform real-world XY-coordinates into SVG screen coordinates...<br/>
                    Includes auto-scaling (responsive) example.

                <dd>Experimenting with different ways to visualise trans-national land-grabbing (for the Dutch magazine
                    Geografie):
                    as a map, as a flow diagram, a force-directed graph and as an OD-matrix...

                <dd>Distances in Europe, as perceived by 1st year Geography students --
                    Students overestimate distances to eastern-European cities compared to Southern-European ones...

                <dd>A test with different ways to compare thematic maps (side-by-side, tranparent overlay, wipe). Made
                    for the experimental <a href="http://kartoweb.itc.nl/NatAtlas/NatAtlasViewer/" target="_blank">National Atlas of
                        the Netherlands</a>...

                    distance equally scaled, as time scaled dependent of distance and as distance scaled dependent of
                    time. Currently the following tracks can be viewed:

                    the Netherlands).
                    Moving the time-slider will show the changes through the years.

                    to show bearing and distance from a location on Earth., where you would normally use a equidistant
                    projection....

                    Langton's ant is a two-dimensional
                    Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complicated emergent behaviour...
