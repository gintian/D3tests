            <b>Standard D3 Maps (using lon-lat geographic coordinates)</b>:
            The standard way the D3 geo methods work is with data in lon-lat geographic coordinates, being
            projected by
            <tt>d3.geo</tt>
            functions. Versatile and powerful, especially if using <tt>topojson</tt> data.

            <a href="RDproj_test/"><b>Maps using projected meter coordinates</b>:</a>
            Map a geojson with cartesian coordinates, instead of lat-lon's (in this case the Dutch RD) --
            Uses an override of standard D3 geo projection behaviour:
            don't perform a full projection and resampling, but only a 1st order (affine) translation and
            scaling to transform real-world XY-coordinates into SVG screen coordinates...<br/>
            Includes auto-scaling (responsive) example.

            time.
