        TWENTE</p>
      <p>This web-map shows the history of the railroads in Twente (a region in 
        of Overijssel province, in the Netherlands). Of each railroad segment, 
        the opening and closing years (and when known, the exact dates) are available. 
        Moving the time-slider will show the changes through the years. The map 
        starts with the year 1928 selected, the year that the railway system was 
        at its most extensive. </p>
      <p>Note that the distinction between &quot;main line&quot; and &quot;branch 
        line&quot; was originally &quot;Hoofdspoorwegen&quot; and &quot;Lokaalspoorwegen&quot;, 
        which is a defined by Dutch law, and quite different from American, British 
        or other systems!</p></td>
